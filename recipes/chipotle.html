<p>We entitled this Chipotle because a long time ago I worked there as a
    prep cook. Sometimes I would jump on the line to serve food to guests
    and you'd ask them exactly what they want on their bowl or burrito. Chicken,
    Beef, Pork, Steak, fajita veggies, sour cream.... damn I'm hungry now.
    Anywho, it acts exactly as an assembly line.
</p>

<p>I pivoted with inspiration to tackle the depths of the lower levels. I want to
    go to the caves of undiscovered stone that is the foundation of computation.
    I've always been curious of beginnings, atoms, roots and even then, there's 
    deeper language than assembly, to the hardware itself. The hum of electricity,
    an abstraction for an abstraction. But I recognize more that computing is all
    about memory location. And binary controls for on/off switches, storing memory
    in the CPU, transferred back into the data hub to go to peripherals and registers
    for active memory.
</p>
<p>I'm getting to the root of it all. Logic, mathematics, thought. Robots were 
    founded not as artificial automatons in the first place but in regards to
    thought itself. Salut 23h03 1/9/2026

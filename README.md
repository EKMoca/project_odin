"Hello Odin! So this is semi a project odin repo/python blog and 
may also contain some logic, discrete math, art or anything about what
I am learning... It may be messy and disorganized but I need somewhere to write

with bioinformatics, neural networks, and robotics practice."

"For the most part, you're going to be seeing the complete dissection and 
exploration of Software Engineering Fundamentals. First Principles."
